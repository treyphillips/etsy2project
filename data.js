Items held for delayed payment will not be shipped until I receive a cleared payment confirmation.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL BUYERS are responsible for ALL additional customs fees, taxes or receiving fees due to policies of their receiving country. First Class International shipping may take 2-4 weeks for delivery. If you are concerned about your order after that time, contact us and we will discuss possible replacement options (if order has not arrived after 30 business days).\r\n\r\nAll USA purchases are send via USPS. Items are sealed in poly bags for moisture protection and shipped inside 3-ply chipboard mailing tubes (or appropriately sized stay-flat envelopes) for further protection. Most orders in the US arrive within 2-5 business days. If you are concerned about your order, please allow the maximum delivery time to lapse before submitting shipping inquiries.\r\n\r\nShipping rates will vary depending on the item and quantity of the order. Rates include handling, postage, delivery confirmation(where applicable) and packaging materials. Due to the increase in costs for international shipping, we have reduced our handling fees to attempt a more affordable shipping experience for our buyers. If you have any more questions, you may either send me an Etsy convo.\r\n\r\nRETURNED SHIPMENTS\r\nCustomers will be contacted if their order has been returned by the USPS. If it is determined the error does not lie with the USPS, we will request further payment from the buyer as well as updated shipping information.","policy_refunds":"As we are a print-to-order business, we do not have a restocking policy and thus cannot accept returns for any reason. Should an item arrive damaged, please provide a photo of the damage and you will be sent a replacement item in the same standard USPS First Class delivery time-frame. The same goes for order which have been sent in error. Provide a photo of the incorrect print and we will quickly dispatch the correct one.\r\n\r\nItems are void from our replacement policy 30 days after shipment. \r\n\r\nWe also do not refund\/cancel orders once it is been marked shipped.  \r\n\r\nSpecial discounts cannot be given after sale has been completed.

(Domestic)\r\nA: We will ship within two business days of payment via USPS. We will send you an email with a tracking number once shipped.

USPS Priority Mail &#39;Usually&#39; takes about 2-5 days but there&#39;s no guarantee and there&#39;s always a chance of delay by USPS.

(International)\r\nA: We will ship within two business days of payment via USPS. We will send you an email with a tracking number once shipped. Many international orders arrive within two weeks from the shipped date but I have had a few that have taken 3-5 weeks to get to their destination due to Customs Clearance (It gets randomly picked by the workers there).

I find discarded prints and paintings (ones you may have inherited from great grandma and brought to your local donation bin), and make additions.  Sometimes I paint monsters, other times zombies, and most times some pop culture reference- Star Wars, Futurama, Ghostbusters, Mario Brothers...the list goes on.  I use oil paints and do my best to match the style of the original artist.  My hope is to take these out of the trash can and into a good home; full-circle- from a print that proudly hung on your Grandma&#39;s wall, to a print that proudly hangs on yours.\r\n\r\nThis print features a thrift store painting which I&#39;ve painted Zoidberg from Futurama into.  Please note that there is some small staining visible on these prints that was on the original painting- you can see them on the photos above.\r\n\r\nBuying multiple prints or posters?  A.

Each piece is a recycled beer can, hand-carved by the artist with a craft knife to create an amazing visual effect. The simple addition of a tealight candle turns each can into a unique portrait lantern featuring a striking silhouette image.\r\n\r\nWe specialise in musical icons, but also feature dozens of portrait designs from the worlds of film, sport, television and popular culture.\r\n\r\nThis item is a totally unique, hand-carved beer can featuring a portrait of Bender from Futurama. The effect works by placing a tealight candle inside (the base is cut out so the can fits over it) allowing the light to shine through the carving creating this amazing silhouette image which looks very cool in a darkened room...
